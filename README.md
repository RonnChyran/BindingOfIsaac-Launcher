Binding of Isaac Launcher: Revamped 
==========================================

Building
========
Open Binding of Isaac Launcher in VS10, and build the solution.

Installer.exe is the installer, and requires the md5 sums of Wrath of the Lamb and the vanilla Binding of Isaac, 
the launcher (named Launcher.exe), the uninstaller, (Uninstaller.exe) and xdelta.exe, as well as the patch from Wrath of the Lamb to vanilla Binding of Isaac (patch.xdelta)
to run. xdelta and the patch should be included, launcher and uninstaller are found in their respective directories in the solution

Launcher.exe is the actual launcher. It will launch Isaac\_Vanilla.exe and Isaac\_WotL.exe respectively (You'll know once built). Since no checks have been added, if one attempts to launch without a file being present, it will throw an exception.


Maintaining
===========
To all who come after me:

Everything should be ready, in case of an update, however, future maintainers, you will need to do a few things  
1. Get the md5 for the latest Wrath of the Lamb EXE, put this in WotL.md5  
2. Get the md5 for the latest Vanilla EXE, put this in Vanila.md5  
4. Rename the Vanilla EXE to "Isaac_Vanilla.exe"  
3. Make a patch with Xdelta, like this   
```
xdelta delta Isaac_WotL.exe Isaac_Vanilla.exe patch.xdelta
```
Pack it all up in a nice WinRAR SFX and you're good to go

Installing
==========
If you're just looking to install it, just download the latest installer from [here](http://punyman.com/projects/Binding%20of%20Isaac%20Launcher%20Installer.exe) and run the installer. Prompts should be easy enough to figure out.

Manual Install
==============
So, you want to install it manually eh?  
Really, all you have to do is get the launcher.exe (which you can get from this repo, or build yourself), rename it to Isaac.exe, and put it in your BoI install folder.  
But, before you do that, rename your Wrath of the Lamb exe to Isaac\_WotL.exe, and if you have the vanilla, rename that to Isaac\_Vanilla.exe, and you should be all good

To patch Wrath of the Lamb to vanilla, get patch.xdelta from this repo, and xdelta.exe from this repo, or somewhere else (Be sure to get xdelta1, not xdelta2 or xdelta3), then patch like so
```
xdelta patch patch.xdelta Isaac_WotL.exe
```
and that should output Isaac\_Vanilla.exe
